Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Write a program to simulate a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
The game will prompt the player to choose rock, paper, or scissors by typing 'r',
'p', or 's'. The computer will randomly select its choice. The game will then display
both choices using emojis and determine the winner based on the rules.

Optional Enhancements
• Modify the game so that the first player (or computer) to win two out of three
rounds is declared the overall winner. This adds a competitive aspect to the game.
• Keep a tally of how many times the player wins, loses, or ties with the
computer. Display these statistics at the end of the game.
• Add an option for two players to play against each other, taking turns to input
their choices. The program should then determine the winner based on their inputs.
