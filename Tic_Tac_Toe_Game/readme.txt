Tic Tac Toe Game
Write a program to create a classic Tic Tac Toe game. Two players take turns
marking Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks
either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.
The board is printed after each move, with colored marks to distinguish between
the players. The game checks for a winner after each move and ends when a
player wins or when the board is full, resulting in a draw.

Optional Enhancements
• Add a scoring system that tracks the number of games won by each player across multiple rounds.
• Allow players to start a new game without restarting the program.
• Modify the game to allow different board sizes (e.g., 4x4 or 5x5) for a more challenging experience.
