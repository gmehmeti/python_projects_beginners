Dice Rolling Game
Write a program that simulates rolling a pair of dice. Each time the program runs, it
should randomly generate two numbers between 1 and 6 (inclusive), representing
the result of each die. The program should then display the results and ask if the
user would like to roll again.

Optional Enhancements
• Modify the program so the user can specify how many dice they want to roll.
• Add a feature that keeps track of how many times the user has rolled the dice
during the session. This will require a counter that increments each time the
dice are rolled.

Instructions:

# Loop
# Ask: Roll the Dice?
# If user enters Y
#  generate two random numbers
#  print them
# If user enters N
#  print thank you message
#  Terminate / Exit from program
# else
#  print invalid choice
