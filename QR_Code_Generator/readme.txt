QR Code Generator
Write a program to generate a QR code based on user input, such as text or a
URL. The QR code should be saved as an image file that can be scanned with a
smartphone.

Optional Enhancements
• Add options for the user to choose the color of the QR code. This will allow
users to generate QR codes that match their style or branding.
• Implement a feature that lets the user generate multiple QR codes at once by
providing a list of URLs or texts. Each QR code should be saved with a unique filename.

Instructions:

# py -m pip install -U qrcode
# https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/
